### To get started
1. `git clone` the repo
2. Navigate to the root project directory and `npm install`
3. `npm start` to run the project on `localhost: 3000`

### Core features
- Allow the app to use your location; this is needed to get localized temperature (I use the coordinates in the initial request)

### Additional Features:
- Load state added
- Now with a prettier UI
- Switch between celsius and farenheit
